As I started learning, HTML ,CSS and JavaScript, I thought doing practical projects is a great way of learning. I did took help and I agree that I didn't do this project entirely on my own but definitly 90 percent was by me. Doing these real time projects built my confidence. So this is my first mini project in Web development.
